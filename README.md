# Twitter_Clone
A 2023 twitter landing page clone, done by me to showcase my progress using just HTML and CSS 
It involved the use of variables for the color scheme,
this was done to make things easy if for any reason I felt the need to switch up the page to the twitter light-mode setup (the default is based on the twitter dark-mode colour scheme)
attached here is a link to a video demo https://twitter.com/olaoluphemy/status/1664583356145717249?s=20
